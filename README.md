# Instacart2021
My name is Stavros Karabinas I am a student of the University of Macedonia and this is a notebook made for a course that i attended. In this assingnment i took data from the company Instacart and used them to create a predictive model in order to better predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order.
